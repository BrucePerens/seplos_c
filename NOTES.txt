 * Although the SEPLOS document refers to this as a Modbus-ASCII protocol, it isn't
 * one. They're confusing the Modbus-ASCII _protocol_, which they don't use, with the
 * RS-485 _transport_, which they use. It seems common to confuse the two. This is more
 * properly called an ASCII-over-RS-485 protocol. Modbus-ASCII packets start with ':'
 * rather than the '~' used by SEPLOS, and the packet format is entirely different.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * The battery is a high-energy device. It's dangerous!
 * Please read the warnings in the README file carefully and completely.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * * So far, I have only tested this with one SEPLOS POLO rack-mounted
 *   battery, which I bought from trophybattery.com
 *
 * * Many of the states have not been tested. I probably can't test them without
 *   writing a battery simulator.
 *
 * * I haven't tested this with a second battery connected to the first.
 * * At this writing, I've not installed the battery where the charger is. Thus
 *   some issues of what is a normal vs. alarm condition, and how the numeric
 *   conversions actually work, will wait until I have the battery installed at
 *   my remote site.
