> **The battery is a high-energy device. _It's dangerous!_**
>
> The battery and this software should be handled only by a person who is fully
> trained in all of the risk presented by a high-energy system.
>  
> You may damage your battery through use of this software, or cause other damage,
> including to life and property. Lithium batteries can catch fire, and can expel
> noxious or toxic gas or liquid. High-current circuits may catch fire. There is
> risk of electric shock, burns, or degloving injury (look it up) due to high
> temperature caused by high current across jewelery or other conductors, and
> blindness, burns, or other injury caused by arc-flash.
>  
> When working on the battery or the system connected to it:
> 
>  *  Take all proper precautions against electric shock, high-temperature burns, and
>     arc-flash.
>  
>  *  Disable the battery using _both_ its manual circuit breaker and its facility
>     to hibernate, along with any similar facilites of your equipment.
>  
>  *  Do not touch any conductor that might be connected, directly or indirectly,
>     to the battery or other energized circuits.
> 
>  *  Do not wear jewelery in the presence of electrical systems that can sustain a
>     high current or voltage. Even in systems with a voltage considered "safe",
>     high current can cause a degloving injury. Photos of degloving injuries are
>     available on the net, and are very disturbing.
>
>  * Protect yourself by using insulating gloves, shoes with non-conductive soles,
>    and an insulating helmet.
>
>  * Have a second person present, who is trained and able to help you if you
>    are shocked or injured. Go over what you plan to do with that person before
>    you act.
>
>  * Maintain situational awareness and think for yourself! There are additional
>    hazards, both known and unknown.
>
>  * Don't rush or skip precautions.
> 
> This software has bugs, omissions, failures, and limitations, both known and
> unknown. It is not possible for software this complicated to be without them.
> This software may cause the battery to work in incorrect, dangerous, damaging,
> or unpredictable ways.
>
> Deliberately changing the parameters of your battery is likely to result in
> danger or damage.
